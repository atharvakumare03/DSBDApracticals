Observations:

For both genders, the median age of survivors is slightly lower than non-survivors.
The range of ages for survivors and non-survivors is wider for females compared to males.
There are outliers in the age distribution, particularly among male survivors, indicating the presence of individuals with extreme ages who survived.
The distribution of ages for male survivors appears to be slightly positively skewed, with a longer upper whisker indicating higher variability in ages among survivors compared to non-survivors.
The median age for both male and female survivors is lower than that of non-survivors, suggesting that younger individuals had a higher chance of survival.
Overall, the box plot shows differences in age distributions between survivors and non-survivors across genders.
