# For categorical variables, you can use one-hot encoding to turn them into quantitative variables.
# However, in the case of the Iris dataset, the 'class' column is already in a numeric format.
# If it wasn't, you could use pd.get_dummies() to perform one-hot encoding.
# For example:
# df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['class'])

# But since it's not necessary in this case, we don't need to perform this step.
